The Application Under Test (AUT) is : ***[qdPM - Free Web-Based Project Management Software](https://qdpm.net/)*** i.e. run locally on the system.

Before you refer to ***[this framework](https://github.com/akshat-raj09/Advanced_Selenium_Framework/tree/master/Advanced_Selenium_Test_Automation_Framework)***, You need to go through ***[Basic Level Framework](https://github.com/akshat-raj09/Selenium_Java_NAL/tree/master/ScreenerTest).***

This is an *Advanced level Test Automation Framework* created using *Selenium - TestNG*, this should give a great start to an intermediate level user to advanced level selenium concepts.

Most of us learn all selenium concepts & basic framework development, but when it comes to advanced framework development, we lag there. This framework should help you on this.

**Framework include below capabilities :-**

**(i)** *Selenium - TestNG - Java.*

**(ii)** *Page Object Model (POM)* using By class locator strategy.

**(iii)** Running Test Cases on *BrowserStack Cloud* using RemoteWebDriver Instance.

**(iv)** *Data Driven Framework* (using Apache POI API to read data from excel files) - Using *@DataProvider* TestNG Annotation.

**(v)** *Threadsafe WebDriver* instance using Singleton pattern.

**(vi)** Threadsafe extent reporting & Setup *Extent Report* via TestNG Listeners.

**(vii)** *Automatic Screenshot Capture of failed test* cases & attaching those screenshots to Extent Report.

**(viii)** Setup Logging (Using *Log4j2 API*) - To Support Parallel Test Execution.

**(ix)** Action Engine â€“ Log every test action in Extent Report / Logger.

**(x)** *Database Validation* in Selenium - Java Test Case (Threadsafe).

**(xi)** Create DataDriven Test for TaskCreation & Execute in Parallel.

**(xii)** *Create Bug / Defect automatically in JIRA from Selenium Test Automation Framework (JIRA Rest API)* & Add Attachment (Screenshot of failed Test Case) to Jira Issue (via Jira Rest API).
